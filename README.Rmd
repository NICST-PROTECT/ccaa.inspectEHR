# d.inspectEHR

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of d.inspectEHR is to provide an early phase light touch quality evaluation for the DECOVID project.
Prior to running these reports, sites *must* apply the DECOVID ddls and *should* try to run ACHILLES against their OMOP database.

## Installation

You can install the development version of d.inspectEHR from [GitHub](https://www.github.com/DocEd/dinspectEHR) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("DocEd/d.inspectEHR")
```

## Running the Report

The report can be run by running the following code.

```r
devtools::load_all()

render_summary_report(
  output = "Summary_report.html",
  prams = list(
    driver = "PostgreSQL",
    host = "localhost",
    port = 5432,
    dbname = "cca_omop",
    schema = "cca_omop",
    user = "######",
    password = "######",
    local_hospital = "ccaa"
  )
)

render_quality_report(
  output = "Data_Quality_report.html",
  prams = list(
    driver = "PostgreSQL",
    host = "localhost",
    port = 5432,
    dbname = "cca_omop",
    schema = "cca_omop",
    user = "######",
    password = "######",
    local_hospital = "ccaa"
  )
)
```

Grab a coffee and enjoy.
